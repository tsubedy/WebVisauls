In this assignment, an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset is built, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

D3 library is used to read in samples.json datafile (provided).

A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu is created that displays the top 10 OTUs found in selected samples.

A bubble chart is created that displays information of each individual sample.

Demographics column is created to display the sample metadata for selected samples (individual's demographic information).

A Gauge Chart is created to plot weekly washing frequency of the individual sample.

Updates are added for each the plots when a new sample is selected.

The dashboard app is deployed to GitHub Pages.
